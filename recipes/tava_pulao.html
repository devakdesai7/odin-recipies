        <p>Tava Pulao is an authentic dish of MUmbai known for its taste and easy-to-make recipe. It is a go to for the locals when they're in a hurry and for
            a fact, they are always in a hurry as a mumbaikar, haha jokes aside, but it is a great option for anyone who wants a tasty and vegetable-rich 
            meal accessible nearby anywhere in Mumbai.
