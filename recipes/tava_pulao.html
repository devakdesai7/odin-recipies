        <p>Tava Pulao is an authentic dish of MUmbai known for its taste and easy-to-make recipe. It is a go to for the locals when they're in a hurry and for
            a fact, they are always in a hurry as a mumbaikar, haha jokes aside, but it is a great option for anyone who wants a tasty and vegetable-rich 
            meal accessible nearby anywhere in Mumbai.

        <ol>
            <li>Rinse 1 cup basmati rice a couple of times in water till it runs clear of starch.

                Then add the rice in a pot or pan along with 4 cups of water. Also add salt to taste and 2 to 3 drops of oil.

                Cook the rice till the grains are tender and softened. The rice grains should be separate yet completely cooked. You can also cook the 
                rice until al dente, if you prefer.</li>

            <li>Drain the rice in a colander. Please do read the recipe card details below on cooking the rice. Let the rice cool completely before you add it
                 to the veggies.</li>

            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a pan and saute ½ teaspoon of cumin seeds till they crackle on low heat.</li>

            <li>Add chopped onions (1 medium onion - 50 grams) and saute the onions stirring often till translucent.</li>

            <li>Add ginger garlic paste (½ inch ginger + 2-3 garlic), made into a paste in a mortar-pestle or 1 teaspoon ginger garlic paste.

                Saute for a few seconds or till their raw aroma goes away. The ginger-garlic paste has to be sauteed well. Otherwise, the raw aroma 
                is felt even later and might not go well with some folks.</li>

            <li>Add 2 large chopped tomatoes (150 grams tomatoes) and 1 medium chopped green bell pepper (capsicum)</li>

            <li>Add 2 teaspoon pav bhaji masala powder, ¼ teaspoon red chili powder and ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.

                Remember to use a really good brand of pav bhaji masala as it is one of the key ingredient in the recipe. The flavor and taste profile
                of tava pulao largely depends on the kind of pav bhaji masala that you will use.
                You can also choose to add homemade pav bhaji masala powder.</li>

            <li>Stir and saute till you see the butter leaving the sides of the pan. About 6 to 7 minutes on a low heat. Even if the bell pepper has a slight crunch, they taste good.
                The tomatoes will also become mushy and soften as you see in the photo below.</li>
            
            <li>Add the chopped steamed cooked veggies - ½ cup peas, 1 small to medium chopped carrot, 1 medium potato and salt as required.
                You can even add french beans, baby corn, broccoli and cauliflower.
                Optionally you can skip adding these boiled or steamed vegetables.</li>

            <li>Stir to mix. Then add the drained cooked rice.</li>

            <li>Stir and mix gently and uniformly.</li>

            <li>Garnish tawa pulao with chopped coriander leaves and drizzled with a few drops of lemon juice (½ teaspoon).</li>
        </ol>
